Java Script password genirator 

## Description
For this project I wanted a password generator that included upper and lower case letters. Also, numbers and special characters


## Why
I created the project to generate a complex password to protect my data .

## What did I learn 
I learned alot this project. I created a couple of for loops. I also created a function to randomize arrays. 
I also sturgled with combinning the arrays and randomizing the data. I was using the randomizer before my for loop which casused my new array to only genrate one random character. once I did this after the for loop it was generating the string correctly.
